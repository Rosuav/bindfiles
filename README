Bind files for Rosuav's domains

To use these, clone the repository onto the server somewhere. The directory
needs to be readable by the bind user, but should be writable only by root;
the easiest way is to clone it as root into /etc/bind/bindfiles.

Install the hook by invoking it, then freshly check out all files, to prime
the serial numbers. This will also create the (untracked) zones file, which
lists all zone files. Add an include directive to /etc/bind/named.conf.local
telling bind to read 'zones'; everything else should be handled automatically.

After any change, pull the latest changes, then reload bind9. Done!

For dynamic updates from DHCP, create a file /var/lib/bind/garden.rosuav.com:

$TTL 7200
@	IN	SOA	gideon.rosuav.com. domains.rosuav.com. (
			0000000000	; Serial
			7200		; Refresh
			3600		; Retry
			2419200		; Expire
			604800 )	; Negative Cache TTL

	IN	NS	gideon.rosuav.com.
	IN	NS	o.rosuav.com.

(serial doesn't matter, it'll be overwritten). The rest of the setup is in
named.conf.local and /etc/dhcp. Similarly, create files for reverse DNS.
