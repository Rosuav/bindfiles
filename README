Bind files for Rosuav's domains

To use these, clone the repository onto the server somewhere. The directory
needs to be readable by the bind user, but should be writable only by root;
the easiest way is to clone it as root into /etc/bind/bindfiles.

Install the hook by invoking it, then freshly check out all files, to prime
the serial numbers. This will also create the (untracked) zones file, which
lists all zone files. Add an include directive to /etc/bind/named.conf.local
telling bind to read 'zones'; everything else should be handled automatically.
